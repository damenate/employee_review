## Employee Reviews

# Description
Objective was to create and track employees through department and their reviews. Then to decide how to give out raises based on those reviews or specific salary.

# Objectives
The goal was to understand blocks in Ruby, classification problems, regular expressions, keyword arguments, how to write methods which call on blocks, and also to practice test driven development.

Through this assignment I was able to create blocks in Ruby and get a better grasp on keyword arguments. This assignment also laid a better groundwork for future test driven development while refining my ability to code.
