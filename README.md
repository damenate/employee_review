# Employee Reviews

## Objective
Objective was to create and track employees through departments and their individual reviews. Then to decide how to give out raises based on those reviews and their current salary.

## Description
The goal was to understand blocks in Ruby, classification problems, regular expressions, keyword arguments, how to write methods which call on blocks, and also to practice test driven development.

Through this assignment I was able to create blocks in Ruby and get a better grasp on keyword arguments. This assignment also laid a better groundwork for future test driven development while refining my ability to code.

## Takeaways
The assignment was a great practice for what we learned in class. The repetition of writing tests was much needed. After this assignment, I understand the need for test driven development but need a lot more practice and review.
