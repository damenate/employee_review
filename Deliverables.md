+ An estimate. After you read through this assignment (but before you start coding), write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3). Record your hours as you go.

+ A GitHub repository.

+ An Employee class in its own file.

+ A Department class in its own file.

+ A quality README.

+ A test suite. Not only must this test suite be conceptually complete,
it must be written before the code that satisfies it.
A reflection on your estimate. Well? How did you do?

assert code` => expects a true to return
refute code` => expects a false to return
examples:
assert object.method_name
assert variable == other_variable
refute variable == other_variabel

assert_equal` => checks equality of expected outcome
assert_equal “Expected String”, object.method_name
refute_equal “Unexpected String”, object.method_name
